# apple-pancake

A [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) web app using Compojure and Hiccup. This is my personal website.

This generated project has a few basics set up beyond the bare Compojure defaults:

* Cookie-backed session store
* Stack traces when in development
* Environment-based config via [enviorn](https://github.com/weavejester/environ)
* [HTTP-based REPL debugging](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/debugging-clojure) via [drawbridge](https://github.com/cemerick/drawbridge)
